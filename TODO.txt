- read and understand what's going on in computeparticles.cpp
- rewrite the simulation as boids with velocity color
- make a new cmake project
- do the writeup
	- we'll have them set up a buffer
	- have them set up shaders that just color everything and move the particles according to random velocity
	- 
	
	
- we'll say that Vulkan can be used for:
	- multiple physical devices
	- multiple CPU threads
	- many command queues
	- but for now we'll focus on a single logical device, on a single physical device, running from a single CPU thread
	
	
	- ohhhh descriptor LAYOUT is attached to pipeline, SET is just interface for shoving data into there. so can have multiple SETs
	
	- looks like a "command buffer" is basically a "job" that you can submit to a Vulkan Queue. So you only have to "dispatch" the job once, because that's not really launching it, it's recording it into a command that you have saved and can submit to the queue again and again
